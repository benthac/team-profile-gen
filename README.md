## This generator will create individual employee cards to be displayed on a webpage

This generator uses inquirer to prompt the user about employee data, including a specific job prompt that follows up with job specific prompts after the question.  Once the user has provided all the relevant info, an html file is generated in addition to the appropriate amount of employee cards that were created during the prompts.

## The HTML file

The html file is generated using the file system module 

## Tests for the classes

Tests were created to ensure that the class functions worked properly
